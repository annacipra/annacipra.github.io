            <p>Hi! My name is Anna Cipra and I'm from Lenexa, KS. I just recently decided to switch my major to Food Science. I am minoring in leadership and entreprenuership. I love to read, workout, draw, and spend time with my friends and family. While you're here, I'll tell you some of my favorite things!</p>
            <ul>
              <li>I love summer most because I love the warm weather, going swimming, and tanning.</li>
              <li>My favorite subject in school is Math. I was always good at math and I like to problem-solve.</li>
              <li>I am more of a dog person, than a cat person. However, my roommate has a cat and I've grown to love her!</li>
              <li>My favorite muscle group to train is arms.</li>
              <li>My favorite food is pulled pork mac and cheese. Something about them together is super good!</li>
              <li>My favorite part about K-State is the exciting atmosphere and traditions, of course also game days.</li>
            </ul>
