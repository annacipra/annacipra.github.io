I am minoring in leadership studies and entreprenuership. I love to read, workout, draw, and spend time with my friends and family. While you're here, I'll tell you some of my favorite things! I love summer most because I love the warm weather, going swimming, and tanning. My favorite subject in school is Math. I was always good at math and I like to problem-solve. I am more of a dog person, than a cat person. However, my roommate has a cat and I've grown to love her! My favorite muscle group to train is arms. My favorite food is pulled pork mac and cheese. Something about them together is super good! Lastly, my favorite part about K-State is the exciting atmosphere and traditions, and of course game days. Want to know more? Keep exploring by clicking the links above!"
